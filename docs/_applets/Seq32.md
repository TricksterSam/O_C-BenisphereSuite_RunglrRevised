# Seq32

![Seq32 Screenshot](images/Seq32.png)

(updated in v1.8.2) The **Seq32** applet reinterprets the 8 pattern storage slots from the original **Sequins** app as 32-step note sequences. (This will corrupt your Sequins patterns, if you have any!)

Each step has a bipolar range of -32 to +31 (scale degrees) and can be Muted or Accented. Accented steps output a longer gate (25%, 50%, 75% or 100% aka tied to the next note), with optional glide. Mute means no gate is sent and the Pitch output doesn't change.

_**Important:**_ In addition to storing applet settings in a Preset, a manual [EEPROM Save](Saving-State) is necessary to save changes to the global patterns!

### I/O

|        |         1/3        |        2/4          |
| ------ | :----------------: | :-----------------: |
| TRIG   |        Clock       |       Reset         |
| CV INs | Transpose<br>(or Pitch CV for Record) | Sequence Select<br>(or Accent gate) |
| OUTs   |        Pitch       |    Gate/Trigger     |

### UI Parameters
* Pattern select #1-8
* Length, per pattern
* Transpose
* Quantizer scale settings (popup editor)
* Gate Length for Accented steps / Glide toggle (AuxButton)
* Record mode
  - Clock trigger records note and advances
  - Reset trigger records rest (muted note) and advances
  - Encoder moves playhead
  - AuxButton toggles mute for current step
* Edit notes

### AuxButton Actions
With certain parameters highlighted for editing, the select button will execute a secondary action:
* Pattern# - Clear pattern
* Length - Randomize current pattern completely
* Transpose - Randomize pitches of current pattern, using transpose as the range
* Accent Gate Length - toggles a slight portamento on accented notes
* Record Mode - mute/unmute current step

### Step Editing
Use the encoder to move the cursor to a step, and push to toggle editing the note value. While editing, use the AuxButton to toggle Mute. Double-click to toggle Accent, indicated by a solid square.

### Record mode
When the small record icon is engaged, the cursor is locked and stepwise CV recording is active. When a Clock trigger is received, CV1 is captured as pitch, CV2 is measured as Accent (gate threshold at 2v), and the sequencer advances. A Reset trigger does the same, except it mutes the step to insert a rest before advancing.

While record mode is engaged, the encoder will move the playhead, and AuxButton toggles mute for the current note.
