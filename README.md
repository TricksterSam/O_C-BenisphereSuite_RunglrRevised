Welcome to Phazerville with Relabi Suite
===

## An active fork expanding upon Hemisphere Suite.

This is a fork of djphazer's Phazerville Suite which is a fork of Benisphere which is a fork of Hemisphere! The code is firmware for the Ornament & Crime, a Eurorack synth module that can act as many different modules as selected by the user. This firmware ads the Relabi app that generates chaotic but deterministic control voltage. In addition, it adds a function to the HSVectorOscillator.h file and provides a controller file that allows two Relabi apps to be linked, providing four related chaotic LFOs.

## What is Relabi.

Relabi is an alternative method of defining musical time. While rhythm is concerned with recurring pulses, relabi always slips the pulse. You can read all about the concept in [John Berndt's essay]((https://johnberndt.org/relabi/).
